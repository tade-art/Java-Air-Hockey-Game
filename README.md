# SCC110-AirHockey

This GUI application allows a user to play an Air Hockey Table game against a friend.

This applicaiton used Java as the main coding language, and used the following libraries (and more) to help:
*javax.swing
*java.awt
*java.util

Java was used for this assignement since it allows Object Orientation Programming, making it easier to create a working game through multiple files. Additionally, it's easy to add more features into the game since all files are separated.

# Controls

*Player 1 (Left Mallet) has access to movement through keys : W A S D
*Player 2 (Right Mallet) has access to movement through keys : I J K L
