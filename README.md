# SCC110-AirHockey

This GUI application allows a user to play an Air Hockey Table game against a friend.

This applicaiton used Java as the main coding language, and used the following libraries (and more) to help:

+ javax.swing
+ java.awt
+ java.util
+ java.sound.sampled

Java was used for this assignement since it allows Object Orientation Programming, making it easier to create a working game through multiple files. Additionally, it's easy to add more features into the game since all files are separated.

# Controls

The players have access to movement through the keys stated below: 

+ Player 1 (Left Mallet) has access to movement through keys : **W A S D**
+ Player 2 (Right Mallet) has access to movement through arrow keys: **UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT**

Additionally, there are miscellaneous controls for the users:

+ Players can press toggle sound via pressing **M** to mute and unmute
+ Players can toggle the size of the Puck by pressing **U**
+ Players can toggle the size of the Mallet by pressing **I**
